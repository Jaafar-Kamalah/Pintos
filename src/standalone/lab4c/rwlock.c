/**
 * This file contains a basic skeleton which you can use to test your
 * readers-writers lock outside of Pintos. It is possible to use it in two ways:
 *
 * - You can run it in the visualization tool available on the course webpage.
 * - You can compile it as usual by typing "make" in the terminal, and
 *   then run "./rwlock" in your terminal.
 *
 * This example contains the "inode" struct from Pintos. As this example does
 * not do any IO, we represent the disk data as a single integer instead. This
 * is enough to trigger the appropriate warnings in the visualization tool at
 * least.
 *
 * You can use the synchronization primitives that are available in Pintos in
 * this file. They are defined in the file "wrap/synch.h" and implemented in
 * "wrap/os.c" if you are interested in how the Pintos versions are implemented
 * in terms of what is available in pthreads (which is typically used in C on
 * UNIX-like systems) and Win32 (which is what is available on Windows).
 *
 * Note: You can use NO_STEP if you have a function you don't want the
 * visualization tool to step through. See what is done to the "inode_open"
 * function below, for example.
